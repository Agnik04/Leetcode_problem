Given a matrix, check if the matrix contains a given key.

The matrix has the following properties:

Integer in each row is arranged in non-decreasing order from left to right.
The first integer in every row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Expected Time Complexity: O(log (n*m))







bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>> &matrix, int key) {
    // add your logic here
	for(int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); ++i)
	{
		for(int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); ++j)
		{
			if(matrix[i][j] == key)
				return true;
		}
	}
	
	return false;
}
